Window / Tab
================
-Window handling in Selenium refers to the process of 
managing multiple browser windows or tabs during test automation.
-It allows you to switch the focus of the WebDriver to 
different windows or tabs, interact with their content, 
and perform actions within each window or tab.
- Window or Tab is technically same
- Window / Tab -> URL / browser controls.

Challenges

- Window URL / Title / Sequence Number can change
- So, how to find the window uniquely?

Selenium Way

- Every new window -> tag it -> new WindowHandle -> String (unique)


Exception

NoSuchWindowException

Close and Quit

How to swtitch to a new window ?

- getWindowHandles()
- Convert Set to List
- Pick the particular window using get(index)
- Switch to the window using the handle
- Close or Quit

open window will be closed by driver.close();
To close all the open window driver.quit();

How to switch to a new window:
-------------------------------
1.how to get the reference?
-getWindowHandle()---when ever u open the window
to get currrent window reference

-getWindowHandles()--to get the reference of all window open

2.How to switch the control
getWindowHandles() return as a Set--remove the duplication

create a list

Two window get()

driver.switch().window(lstname.get(0))

convert set into list

pick the particular window using get(index)

apply the driver.switch().window(lstname.get(0))

close/quit



Class Room 3:
Navigate to https://www.irctc.co.in/
Click on FLIGHTS link
Switch to the Flights window
Print the Title of the Flights window
Close the Flights window alone
Print the Train search window title (First window)



SnapShot:
=========
a snapshot (or screenshot) refers to capturing an image of the current state of a web page 
or a specific element on the page.
Taking snapshots can be helpful for various purposes, 
---debugging
---error reporting
---generating test evidence.

To capture a snapshot in Selenium Java,
you can use the TakesScreenshot interface provided by Selenium WebDriver.

The getScreenshotAs method is called to capture the screenshot 
as a byte array (OutputType.BYTES), 
which you can further process or save to a file using libraries like Apache Commons IO.

Taking snapshots:
can help you troubleshoot issues, verify expected states,
and provide visual evidence of test execution.
                 //Take a snapshot
		Step1:		File source = driver.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
				//Create folder to save the img file
		Step2:		File dest =new File("./snap/img1.png");
				//Merge source and destination
		Step3:		FileUtils.copyFile(source, dest);

Ensure that you have the Apache Commons IO library added to your project dependencies
to use the FileUtils class for file operations.


Actions Class
----------------
the Actions class is a feature that allows you to simulate advanced user
interactions involving the mouse and keyboard. 
It provides a set of methods to perform various actions such as clicking,
hovering, dragging and dropping, double-clicking, right-clicking, and entering text.

The Actions class is part of the org.openqa.selenium.interactions package in Selenium WebDriver.
To use the Actions class, you need to create an instance of it by passing the WebDriver instance as a parameter.

Advanced user Interaction
-------------------------
click
sendkeys
clear
getText()
getAttribute()

Advanced user interactions:
------------------------------
Mouse and keyboard

Actions class

Action class is not throw any exception
-----------------------------------------
1.MouseHover
-------------
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.moveToElement(webElement).perform();

2.Droppable
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.dragAndDrop(source,destination).perform();

3.Draggable
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.dragAndDropBy(webElement,x,y).perform();
Drag and DropBy

4.RightClick
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.contextclick(webElement).perform();

5.DoubleClick
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.doubleclick(webElement).perform();

6.ScrollDown
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.scrollToElement(webElement).perform();

7.Select
--------
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);

// Step1 : Create object for Actions class
		Actions builder = new Actions(driver);

// step2: use appropriate method to do the action
builder.clickAndHold(WebElement).moveToElement(WebElement).release().perform();

// perform() is mandatory at the end of actions

8.sort the element:
Actions builder=new Actions(driver);
builder.dragAndDrop(item6,item1).dragAndDrop(item2,item 3).perform
builder.dragAndDropBy(webElement,x,y).perform();

9.keys action:

builder.keyDown(Keys.CONTROL).click(WebElement).click(WebElement).click(WebElement).click(WebElement).keyUp(Keys.CONTROL).perform();
				other method:
builder.clickAndHold(item1).moveToElement(item4).release().perform();
Keyboard Methods:
======================
sendKeys(keysToSend) : sends a series of keystrokes onto the element
keyDown(theKey) : Sends a key press without release it. Subsequent actions may assume it as pressed. (example: Keys.ALT, Keys.SHIFT, or Keys.CONTROL)
keyUp(theKey): Performs a key release

Mouse Actions:
==========================

click (): Simply click on element
doubleClick (): Double clicks onElement
contextClick() : Performs a context-click (right click) on an element
clickAndHold(): Clicks at the present mouse location (without releasing)
dragAndDrop(source, target): Invokes click-and-hold at the source location and moves to the location of the target element before releasing the mouse. source – element to grab, target – element to release
dragAndDropBy(source, xOffset, yOffset): Invokes click-and-hold at the source location and moves to the location and release
moveToElement(toElement): It shifts the mouse to the center of the element
release(): Releases the depressed left mouse button at the existing mouse location
